		<div class="blurb">For the last three decades the United States and Iran have been locked in a deadly embrace-so much so that they have been dubbed “bitter” even “eternal” enemies. Much of this hostility is rooted in the 1953 coup in which the CIA overthrew the highly popular government of Muhammad Mossadeq and thus laid the groundwork for the establishment of the autocratic rule of Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. The 1953 coup, in turn, is rooted in the 1951-53 oil crisis between Iran and Britain.</div>
